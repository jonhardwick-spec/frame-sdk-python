### Features Developed and Implemented:
1. **Autistic Tool Memory**: Captures and stores information such as card details, IDs, passports, business cards, and handheld devices. Stores data for a maximum of 3 days and ensures encryption for safety. Access to this data is restricted to government authorities.
   
2. **TrafficCutUp Mode**: Assists the user in navigating through traffic, identifying openings, and suggesting optimal routes for efficient travel.
   
3. **Enhanced Psychological and Heuristic Analysis**: Collects data from visible individuals (IDs, mood, mental disorders, body language, etc.) and uses it for social and psychological profiling. Features data encryption for sensitive information.
   
4. **OCR & Number Gathering (OCD)**: Detects and captures numbers or strings of text from images or videos. Includes dynamic number tracking for financial or order-based information. Green outline feedback provided to users.
   
5. **Emergency Vehicle Detection (EVS)**: Detects police cars, ambulances, fire trucks, and other emergency vehicles. Alerts the user of detected vehicles’ directions for awareness.
   
6. **Social Media Integration**: Social media profile retrieval using images, names, and outfits. Captures social media handles and links to users for advanced social engineering and profiling.
   
7. **Gesture Recognition**: Custom gestures to control features like data capture, secure data access, and media control. Includes secure gestures for authorized government personnel.
   
8. **Secure Data Encryption & Storage**: Uses advanced encryption for all sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized personnel can decrypt and retrieve the data. Ensures access to secure data is logged for government use.
   
9. **PAED (Psychological Analysis Emotional Detection)**: Analyzes the emotional state and mood of individuals based on their behavior and expressions. Helps in determining honesty and trustworthiness through facial expression analysis.
   
10. **Data Retrieval by Law Enforcement**: Provides the ability for law enforcement or authorized government agents to retrieve stored data by entering the proper passcode, ensuring accountability.
   
11. **Secure Data Retrieval UI**: Allows authorized government personnel to scroll through collected profiles (like a TikTok feed) for ease of access to sensitive information when needed.
   
12. **Saturation and Exercise Mode**: Tracks the user’s health metrics, exercise habits, calories burned, and saturation levels based on food consumption and exercise routines. Provides feedback for optimal exercise and fitness performance.
   
13. **Aim Assist**: Improves targeting and accuracy through real-time analysis and assistance with visual recognition technology.
   
14. **Computer Vision & Recognition**: Extensive computer vision capabilities, recognizing objects, faces, and key details in the user’s environment to assist with various features.
   
15. **Secure Authentication**: Includes a secure authentication method for government officials with encrypted password and biometric recognition for emergency data retrieval.
